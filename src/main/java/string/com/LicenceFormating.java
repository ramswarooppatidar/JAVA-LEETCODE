		Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
		Explanation: The string s has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
		Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
		Example 2:
		
		Input: s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2
		Output: "2-5G-3J"
		Explanation: The string s has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.
